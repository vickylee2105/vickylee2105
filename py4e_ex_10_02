10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name=input('enter file')
if len(name)<1: name='mbox-short.txt.'
handle=open(name)

ddd=dict()

for line in handle:
  if line.startswith('From '):
    line=line.split() #把字一個個切開
    time=line[5] #選出第6順序的東西出來，從0開始數會數到5
    hour=time[0:2] #只需要取前2個數字，即從0到2但不包含2
    ddd[hour]=ddd.get(hour,0)+1
    
for k,v in sorted(ddd.items()):
  print(k,v)
