aggregate functions
MAX() 
MIN()
SUM()
COUNT()
AVG()

COUNT(*)-counts all the rows in a table containing values ot NULL values.
用*就是所有值包含空白也會計算進去
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM Customers;

COUNT(column)-counts all the rows in a specific column ignoring NULL values.
用某個column就會忽略空白，只會計算有值的column
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID) AS total_customers
FROM Customers;

NULL values are ignored by the MIN/MAX/AVG functions.

cannot use DISTINCT on COUNT(*)
no value to use with MIN and MAX functions.

HAVING
- WHERE does not work for groups
- WHERE filters on rows
- so we use HAVING to filter for groups

WHERE vs HAVING
- WHERE filters before data is grouped
- HAVING filters after data is grouped
- rows eliminated by WHERE will not be included in the group

ORDER BY sorts data
GROUP BY does not sort data
